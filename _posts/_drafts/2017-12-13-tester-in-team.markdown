<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>aving a tester in your team might bring a great value but it might be also a problematic part.</p>

I went to several interviews quite recently and I have to say that every interview was totally different. And why it was so different? Because the expectations from the "tester" position were different. 

#### We wanna monkey that do the stuff

I'll start with the bad example. At least for me it was a hell. I came there and first of all I got a test. Really a bunch of papers with questions and tasks that I should finish. I said "Hey, I think it would be nice to tell me something about the position first, maybe I won't be really interested in the test anymore." So they told me at least something and then expected to do the tests. But no wonder that I was already bad-tempered and reserved. 
So I did the test. There was a programming on paper (sweet), SQL on paper (also sweet, one does SQL on paper often in real life!), some testing stuff and also some moreless advanced bash commands. 
To be honest I was not prepared for any test, because I expected a chat about the position and about myself first because we can easily find out that it won't be fit anyway. 
Of course I did not do everything in the test - especially bash commands because I don't use it on daily basis as kinda UI user of Mac and Win, what I need in bash is already written somewhere and I google for it or I have "commonly used" bash commands in some cheatsheet. 
In SQL I forgot to include order by - oh, I would not find out during the SQL execution, right? And I did not have enough time to finish the programming part, so I miss ":" in for cycle. So they checked that and responded "Hm, the for loop will not work." My response was like: "No kidding, I know I forgot some syntax stuff cos I ran out of time." I just looked at that and told them what would be the correct code and also I said I forgot the order by in SQL. 
But they looked like I screwed a lot. Sure, but they screwed a lot as well. And on the top of that they told me they do the test automation in MS Excel (what the ...) so they could have saved 1 hour of my time if they had told me that at the very beginning. :)
But it is kinda obvious what they expect from a tester in the team - no personal dynamics, no unique way of thinking, no will to grow. They just need someone who's gonna do all the nasty stuff they don't want to do themselves. It is no surprise then that they offer really generous salary. 
But seriously, you don't want to stuck in a hell just to be paid well. 

#### We wanna teammate and a buddy we can rely on

This experience was totally diffeerent. I came to their office and they were smiling to me, starting with some chit chat, making the atmospehere really friendly. So I could open up myself, I felt safe and self-confident. 
All the interview took longer than the first one, but there was no test. It was freindly talk about their company and a project and about myself. Of course, they also tested my skills but naturally during the conversation. They asked me how to do something, how to solve something. Just no pressure. No forgotten "order by". Even if we found out that I don't have all the skills they need currently, it was clear that it would not be that big problem because they were not looking for just specific skillset or just a monkey who will do their nasty stuff. They were really looking for a valuable team member who can do anything in future. They were looking for the ability to grow, for open minded person with good personal dynamics. 
And yes, it was a fit. 
At the end I declined that offer just because I decided to continue on my current project, becaue we had some great plans for great refactoring of the codebase in which I could participate also as a developer (for smaller things), but one never knows what's gonna happen next so maybe I will ask them again to reconsider myself. :)

#### So what do you want?
And what do you expect from your tester? To be just an invisible part of the team who does not care much or do you want a valueable team member who will push his/her limits to be the best?

If you go for the first option, don't expect that the tester will do anything beyond the main responsibility. Why would he if you don't appreciate his/her value anyway? 
Such a tester will be bored all the time, not attached to the product or the team and he/she will not bring a great value to the team anyway. You can guess what will be the overall atmosphere in the team. 

But if you go for the second option, you can be sure that such a tester will be more than happy to participate in any team activity - from backlog refinement to delivery to the end user and you can be sure you can rely on him/her. Also the atmosphere in the team will be much better, because the tester will be widely accepted. Such a tester will always care for the product and the team and that's what brings the value. 

What is your experience from interviews to tester position?

What are your expectations as interviewer of a tester?
