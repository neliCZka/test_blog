<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>ncreasing productivity and effectivity at work is very hot topic nowadays. May remote work be a good way to increase the productivity?</p>



We all realize that our time is limited so we should spend our time wisely. Especially when it comes to work. 
But are we really spending our working time wisely? 

I doubt so. 

Here's why. If you work at a company, in some office, let's have a look around you. What do you see?
I bet you see many colleagues browsing various work unrelated pages. Other colleagues having friendly talk at kitchenette. Others are trying to persuade colleagues to play some games. There are also people who pretend to be extremely busy but the outcome is none. 
If it is not like that, than congrats. Otherwise welcome to totally average office. 

When I am at office, I am trying to do my best, but there's so many distractions. It is very hard to really focus on work so at the end of the day the 8 hours working day was not effective for all the time. 

And that bothers me. I feel my time is very valuable and I don't want to loose few hours every day just trying to focus on something while being distracted. 

#### So how to get out of that?

I am sure there are many options how to be really productive and effective at work, but I haven't explored them yet. 
So far I've explored just one option and it worked suprisingly well for me. 

#### Leave your office, leave your flat, leave your town. Become a digital nomad.

I decided to try working from coworking and coliving space AngkorHUB at Siem Reap, Cambodia. 
I just bought tickets and 2 days later I was siting on the plane from Prague with no idea whether remote working from totally unkown area is the right move, whether it may work well for me or not. I've never been to any coworking space before, so I was not sure what to expect.
Surprisigly enough it worked well for me. There were many variables affecting my work for sure, but I think of 4 main reasons, why I was finally more effective and productive at work.

#### 1. No distractions from colleagues
People who work at coworking space are there really for a work to do. They are not coming to an office just to show their boss that they are there for 8 hours. 
They have serious work to be done and they want to be effective.

#### 2. Your time feels even more limited
Yes, you are at new place, you want to explore surroundings, do some trips and make some friends so you know your time is even more limited. You don't want to loose any time by watching youtube or preparing coffee for 15 minutes.

#### 3. It costs you a lot
Flight tickets, accommodation, fee for coworking space and much much more are the expenses you have now in addition to your common expenses. You don't want to waste all the money just for nothing, right?

#### 4. No distractions based on your well known environment
This is probably the biggest difference between being remote from home office and being remote as a digital nomad. 
I am far from the person who just pretends to be working at home office. However I realize that there are many distractions at home. It is always like "let's put the clothes to washing machine", "let's prepare some food", "let's have a nap for a while" and here you are, all the focus is switched for so many times. 
When you are at coworking space, you don't care about anything but work itself and that's great. 

But of course, I don't want to say that we should not have any breaks during the work. I want to say that you and only you must be the master of your working time to be more effective. Nobody else should distract you from the focus. If you master your working time, I believe you can finish your work in 4 hours instead of 8 and that's amazing, right?
