	<p>Well, or maybe not really. I just want to keep on improving my skills and share my knowledge with the others, because the beginnings are always difficult, so we all should cooperate and make the testing path easier to each other. :)</p>
  <p>I really enjoy test automation and I always try to be a valuable member of an agile team. So I am always involved in every activity of the team from refinement to deployment itself and I love it!</p>
  <p>When I don't do IT, I usually wander around the world with my Canon camera or just go to gym.</p>
  <p> This blog is mainly about sharing my knowledge, my success stories and also my failures, so hopefully you can avoid mistakes I already made exploring the test automation field. :) </p>

  <p> I am a freelancer now so <b>don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:n.nelis.s@gmail.com">contact me</a></b> if you need a tester, who rocks, on your project! </p>
